Conversations
==

###About
Conversations is a refactor of a Ruby project I started a long time ago.  It's essentially a Magic Eight Ball application, you ask it a question and it returns a canned answer.  The comparisons are made via a Levenshtein string comparison, and the closer distance answer is returned.

I have plans to make several characters with different responses, so maybe the characters could even reply to each other with their own answers and have a faux conversation.

###Installation

1. ```npm install```

2. ```bower install```

3. ```grunt serve``` or ```grunt build```
